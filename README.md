## Features:
•	Simulated the motion of ropes using a mass-spring system to achieve realistic motion effects.  
•	Calculated the position, velocity, and acceleration using both the Euler method and the Verlet method.  

## Notes:
I ran this code in the Linux system.  
It Is implemented for learning purposes.
